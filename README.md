The United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have become an important guideline for higher-education and research institutions to monitor and plan their contributions to social, economic, and environmental transformations.

The `text2sdg` package is the first open-source, multi-system analysis package that identifies SDGs in text, opening up the opportunity to monitor any type of text-based data, including scientific output and corporate publications.


## General Information

The `text2sdg` package is developed by Dirk U. Wulff and Dominik S. Meier, with contributions from Rui Mata and the <a href="https://cds.unibas.ch/">Center for Cognitive and Decision Sciences</a>. It is published under the GNU General Public License.

An overview of the package can be accessed
