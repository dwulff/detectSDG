Title: Detecting UN Sustainable Development Goals in Text
Description: The United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have become an important guideline for organisations to monitor and plan their contributions to social, economic, and environmental transformations. The text2sdg package is an open-source analysis package that identifies SDGs in text using scientifically developed query systems, opening up the opportunity to monitor any type of text-based data, such as scientific output or corporate publications.
