Description: The United Nationsâ€™ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) have become an important guideline for higher-education and research institutions to monitor and plan their contributions to social, economic, and environmental transformations. The text2sdg package is the first open-source analysis package that identifies SDGs in text, opening up the opportunity to monitor any type of text-based data, such as scientific output or corporate publications.
