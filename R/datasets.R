#' SDG queries of the Aurora Universities Network
#'
#' A dataset containing the SDG queries version 5.0 of the \href{https://aurora-universities.eu/}{Aurora Universities Network}. See the corresponding \href{https://github.com/Aurora-Network-Global/sdg-queries}{GitHub repository}. For the actual implementation of the queries see \code{aurora_simple}, \code{aurora_and}, \code{aurora_w}, and the queries hard-coded in \code{detect_aurora}. There are multiple queries per SDG (one per row). In comparison to previous versions, this version of the queries Aurora added more keywords related to academic terminology to be able to detect more research papers related to the SDGs. The current version also drew inspiration from the SIRIS query system (\code{siris_queries}). The Aurora queries were designed to be precise rather than sensitive. To achieve this the queries make use complex keyword-combinations using several different logical search operators. All SDGs (1-17) are covered.

#' SDG queries of SIRIS Academic
#'
#' A dataset containing the SDG queries of \href{http://www.sirislab.com/lab/sdg-research-mapping/}{SIRIS Academic}. The queries are available from\href{https://zenodo.org/record/3567769#.YRY9xdMzY8N}{Zenodo.org}. The SIRIS queries were developed by extracting key terms from the UN official list of goals, targets and indicators as well from relevant literature around SDGs. The query system has subsequently been expanded with a pre-trained word2vec model and an algorithm that selects related words from Wikipedia. There are multiple queries per SDG (one per row). There are no queries for SDG-17.

#' SDG queries of Elsevier
#'
#' A dataset containing the SDG queries of \href{https://www.elsevier.com/connect/sdg-report}{Elsevier} (version 1). The queries are available from \href{https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/87txkw7khs/1}{data.mendeley.com}. The Elsevier queries were developed to maximize SDG hits on the Scopus database. A detailed description of how each SDG query was developed can be found \href{https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/87txkw7khs/1}{here}. There is one query per SDG. There are no queries for SDG-17.

The authors of these queries first created an ontology from central keywords in the SDG UN description and expanded these keywords with keywords they identified in SDG related research output. There are multiple queries per SDG. All SDGs (1-17) are covered.
